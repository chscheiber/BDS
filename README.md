# Final BDS Project Project_ 33

## About our Project
The goal of our BDS Project is to answer the following research question:
"How does the opinion of a president influence the spread of the corona virus"

## CEO Perspective
To provide a high level overview about the research question we decided to generate a D3js Dashboard
to visualize the spread of the corona virus in the United States over time in comparison
to Donald Trumps opinion on the corona virus. The opinion of Donald Trump is calculated using a
sentiment analysis on a subset of his tweets. This subset contains all tweets issued by him which
contain at least one predefined term.

## Data Engineer 
To create a reusable app all the data we are using is provided via a REST API. 
This data is generated by an ETL-Pipeline which queries, transforms and provides Donald Trumps tweets and up-to-date
data concerning the corona virus.

## Implementation
For the implementation of our project we are using a Full Stack approach with Python running in the backand
and a JavaScript Frontend. The Visualizations were created with D3js, the styling is done via bootstrap.
